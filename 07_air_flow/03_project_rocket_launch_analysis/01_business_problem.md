There is an API `https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.0.0/launch/upcoming` which provides the details about upcoming rocket launches.</br>
Here is how the response looks like:</br>
```python
"results": [

{  
"id": "528b72ff-e47e-46a3-b7ad-23b2ffcec2f2",

This is what needs to be done:</br>
Hit the API --> Consume response & find image URL's --> Fetch those images.
