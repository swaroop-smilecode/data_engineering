- In Amazon Athena you can use workgroups to separate users, teams, applications, or workloads,</br>
  to set limits on amount of data each query or the entire workgroup can process.
- By default, if you have not created any workgroups, all queries in your account run in the primary workgroup.
- You can also use workgroups to track costs.
- Because workgroups act as resources, you can use resource-level identitybased policies to control access to a specific workgroup.
