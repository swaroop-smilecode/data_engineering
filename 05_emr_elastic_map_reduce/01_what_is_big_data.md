#### What is big data?
Big data primarily refers to data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by</br>
traditional data-processing application software.

If the data that needs to be analyzed, is having below characteristics, then it's called as big data.</br>
1. Volume</br>
   Size of the data is in Tera bytes / Peta bytes.
3. Variety</br>
   Data is coming from many sources such as sql database, no sql database etc.</br>
   The reason for this is: when you look at an application built using micro services architecture,</br>
   one micro service could store the data in no-sql db & other could store in sql db.</br>
   but, when data needs to be analysed, you need to collect the data from all applications.
5. Velocity</br>
   Data that needs to be analyzed keeps increasing rapidly w.r.t time.
