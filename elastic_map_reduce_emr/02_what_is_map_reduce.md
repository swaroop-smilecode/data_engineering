#### What is map reduce?
When we have huge amount of data, our traditional approach of setting up an server in single linux machine &</br>
then making an API call to process the data is not going to work(I mean, it will work, but takes weeks/months of time).

So, we need an architecture to split huge data into small parts, analyze paralally & then combine results at the end.</br>
That way, we can process huge amount of data & that architecture is nothing but map reduce.</br>

An example of map reduce in real life is collecting census:</br>
In this analogy:</br>
map phase = census officers going to various cities for collecting the data.</br>
reduce phase = all the data is combined & single report is published.
