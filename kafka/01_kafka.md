#### What is kafka?
- Kafka is nothing but a queue cluster.</br>
- In micro services architecture, one application communicates with another through queue.</br>
  Producers are those applications which insert messages into queue & Consumers messages.</br>
- Synonyms:</br>
  queue = messaging system</br>
  cluster = distributed platform</br>

- Each node is a queue. Since queue is the one through which communication happens between Producer & Consumer,</br>
  it's also called as Broker.
