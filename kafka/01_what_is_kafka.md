#### What is kafka?
- Kafka is nothing but a queue cluster.</br>
- In micro services architecture, one application communicates with another through queue.</br>
  Producers are those applications which insert messages into queue & Consumers consume messages.</br>
- Synonyms:</br>
  Queue = messaging system = kafka server = node = broker</br>
  Cluster = distributed platform</br>
  From now onwards, will use the words `broker` & `cluster`.
