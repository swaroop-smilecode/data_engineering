#### What's apache air flow?
In Airflow, we create an DAG(Directed Acyclic Graph) & that graph is the workflow. Each node in that graph is nothing but a task.</br>

#### What's AWS has to do with apache air flow?
Since apache air flow is open source software, it publicly explained about the internal architecture in the docs.</br>
So, we our selves can create below setup, but again what about setup cost, scalability, availability, security & upgrading version ?</br>
That's where AWS comes into picture. It setup's apache airflow & provides you as a ready made service, hence called as managed service.</br>
