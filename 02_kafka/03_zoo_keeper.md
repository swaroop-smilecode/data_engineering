#### What is zoo keeper?
- It's like terraform dedicated to work with kafka cluster.
- To put it in another way, it's an configuration & synchronization system.</br>
- Through zoo keeper, will configure kafka cluster.
- When ever we change the configuration, zoo keeper makes changes to the cluster.</br>
  That's synchronizing the configuration & actual kafka cluster.
