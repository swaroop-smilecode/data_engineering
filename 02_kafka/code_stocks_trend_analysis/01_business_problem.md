There is an application named `register_user_application`, through which new users get registered.</br>
Business wants insights about on real time basis(When you say real time, not once in a week/once in 15 days which is batch processing).</br>
The moment new user got registered, he should be included in the data we are analysing.</br>

These are the details which business wants.</br>
1. How many users are registered as of now?</br>
2. Show the users data/each year.</br>
