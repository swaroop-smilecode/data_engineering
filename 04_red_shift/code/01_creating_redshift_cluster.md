#### Types of red shift services available
There are 2 variants of red shift.
1. Red shift cluster
2. Red shift server less 

#### Red shift server less 
Since red shift cluster is going to be much costlier, hence will go with server less option.
- After creating redshift, you can see end point of that redshift(Nothing but an API exposed by redshift), in details of instance.</br>
  That's the url through which we can communicate with red shift.
