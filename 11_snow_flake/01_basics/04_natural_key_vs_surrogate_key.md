#### Unique key's
- Suppose you set up state_code as primary key & we know that there can't be multilpe primary keys in a table.</br>
  But, suppose you want data in another column also to be unique. How to achieve that? That's where unique key comes
  into picture.

#### Foreign key
How do you avoid entry QX? That's where foreign key comes into picture.

#### Surrogate key
As of now, you selected state_code as the primary key.</br>
This state_code is naturally part of the data present in database table.</br>
Suppose, you want to create an artificial unique data & use it as a primary column, that's nothing but the surrogate key.</br>
It has meaning only in the context database. For example; no one outside the database can say 25 == Georgia.
